# Map Marklet Backend

## Synopsis
- Map Marklet is a Chrome extension that lets users save urls to markers on a personal instance of Google Maps.

## Motivation
-While planning for road trips, I often save bookmarks to many websites which I then reference later. However, it's difficult to know the locations the websites refer to. This Chrome extension helps me locate the places the websites refer to on a map.

## Installation
- Clone the repo and `npm i`

## Tech Stack
- Koa
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
